This program provides integrity monitoring that checks file or directory of container to determine whether or not they have been tampered with or corrupted.  
integrity-sum, which is a type of change auditing, verifies and validates these files by comparing them to the stored data in the database.

If program detects that files have been altered, updated, added or compromised, it rolls back deployments to a previous version.

integrity-sum injects a `hasher-sidecar` to your pods as a sidecar container. 
`hasher-sidecar` the implementation of a hasher in golang, which calculates the checksum of files using different algorithms in kubernetes:
* MD5
* SHA256
* SHA1
* SHA224
* SHA384
* SHA512

## Getting Started
### Clone repository and install dependencies
```
$ cd path/to/install
$ git clone https://github.com/ScienceSoft-Inc/integrity-sum.git
```
Download the named modules into the module cache
```
go mod download
```

## Demo-App
You can test this application in your CLI â€” Command Line Interface on local files and folders.   
You can use it with option(flags) like:
1) **`-d`** (path to dir):
```
go run cmd/demo-app/main.go -d ./..
```
2) **`-a`** (hash algorithm):
```
go run cmd/demo-app/main.go -a sha256
go run cmd/demo-app/main.go -a SHA256
go run cmd/demo-app/main.go -a SHA256 -d ./..
```
3) **`-h`** (options docs):
```
go run cmd/demo-app/main.go -h
```

## :hammer: Installing components
### Running locally
The code only works running inside a pod in Kubernetes.
You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using `minikube`.  
Example https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

### Install Helm
Before using helm charts you need to install helm on your local machine.  
You can find the necessary installation information at this link https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

### Configuration
To work properly, you first need to set the configuration files:
+ environmental variables in the `.env` file
+ values in the file `helm-charts/database-to-integrity-sum/values.yaml`
+ values in the file `helm-charts/app-to-monitor/values.yaml`

## Quick start
### Using Makefile
You can use make function.  
Runs all necessary cleaning targets and dependencies for the project:
```
make all
```
Remove an installed Helm deployments and stop minikube:
```
make stop
```
Building and running the project on a local machine:
```
make run
```
If you want to generate binaries for different platforms:
```
make compile
```
### Manual start
Set some environment variables to configure DB params:
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_USER
- DB_NAME

They will be stored in a secret on the cluster during deployment and used to create application DB and manage connections to it.

Minikube start:
```
minikube start
```
Build docker images hasher:
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t hasher .
```

Then update the on-disk dependencies to mirror Chart.yaml.
```
helm dependency update helm-charts/database-to-integrity-sum
```
This command installs a chart archive.
```
helm install `release name` `path to a packaged chart`
```
There are some predefined targets in the Makefile for deployment:
- Install helm chart with database 
    ```
    make helm-database
    ```
- Install helm chart with app
    ```
    make helm-app
    ```

## Pay attention!
If you want to use a hasher-sidecar, then you need to specify the following data in your deployment:
+ `main-process-name: "your main process name"`
+ `template:spec:serviceAccountName:` api-version-`hasher` 
+ `template:shareProcessNamespace: true`

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes you may find that pod is injected with sidecar container as expected, check the following items:

1) The pod is in running state with `hasher-sidecar` sidecar container injected and no error logs.
2) Check if the application pod has he correct labels `main-process-name`.

#### Presents the documentation as a web page.
```go
godoc -http=:6060/integritySum
go doc packge.function_name
```
for example
```go
go doc pkg/api.Result
```

## :mag: Running tests
First of all you need to install mockgen:
```
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@${VERSION_MOCKGEN}
```

Generate a mock:
```
go generate ./internal/core/ports/repository.go
go generate ./internal/core/ports/service.go
```
You need to go to the folder where the file is located *_test.go and run the following command:
```go
go test -v
```

for example
```go
cd ../pkg/api
go test -v
```
or
```
go test -v ./...
```
## :mag: Running linter "golangci-lint"
```
golangci-lint run
```
