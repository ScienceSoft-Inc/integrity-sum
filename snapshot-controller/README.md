# crd

This project contains a code for creating snapshot CRD and k8s controller for it. Based on `kubebuilder` generated files.

## Description

A snapshot CRD is a k8s representation of the image snapshot. It contains a list of files and their hashes encoded into a single base64 string.

A snapshot CRD controller is a tool for managing CRD snapshots. When new CRD is found the controller will read the data from it and upload this data with appropriate MinIO object.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Custom Resources Definition into the cluster:

    ```sh
    make install
    ```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/
    ```

3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/controller:tag
    ```

4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/controller:tag
    ```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```


### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```


## How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
